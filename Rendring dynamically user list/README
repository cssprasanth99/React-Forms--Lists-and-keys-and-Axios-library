### README: User Filter App

This README provides an overview and usage guide for the User Filter App.

#### Overview
The User Filter App is a simple React application that allows users to filter through a list of users based on their first name or last name. Users can enter a search query in the input field, and the app will dynamically filter and display users whose names match the search query.

#### Usage

1. **Installation**
   - Clone the repository to your local machine.
   - Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

2. **Filtering Users**
   - Upon opening the application, you will see an input field labeled "Enter username".
   - Enter a search query in the input field to filter users. The app will dynamically update the list of displayed users based on the search query.
   - The search query is case-insensitive, and users whose first name or last name contains the search query will be displayed.

3. **Viewing User Profiles**
   - The filtered users are displayed as user profiles, showing their avatar (profile picture) and full name.
   - Scroll through the list of user profiles to view the filtered users.
   - Each user profile includes the user's avatar and full name (concatenation of first name and last name).

#### Project Structure
- `index.html`: HTML file containing the application structure and script tags.
- `app.js`: JavaScript file containing the React components and application logic.
