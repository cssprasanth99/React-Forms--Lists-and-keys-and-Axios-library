### README: Greeting Card App

This README provides an overview and usage guide for the Greeting Card App.

#### Overview
The Greeting Card App is a simple React application that displays a list of greeting cards. Each greeting card contains a personalized greeting message and the recipient's name. The application is designed to demonstrate basic React component rendering and data mapping.

#### Usage

1. **Installation**
   - Clone the repository to your local machine.
   - Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

2. **Viewing Greeting Cards**
   - Upon opening the application, you will see a list of greeting cards displayed on the webpage.
   - Each greeting card contains a greeting message and the recipient's name.
   - The greeting cards are populated with sample data, but you can modify the data as needed in the `arr` array in the `App` component.

3. **Customizing Greeting Cards**
   - To customize the greeting cards, edit the `arr` array in the `App` component.
   - Each object in the `arr` array represents a greeting card and contains two properties: `greeting` (the greeting message) and `name` (the recipient's name).
   - Modify the values of `greeting` and `name` as desired to create personalized greeting cards.
